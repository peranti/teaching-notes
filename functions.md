We can related functions back to a concept learners are already
familiar with: programs in shell. Like shell programs, functions:

 - Perform one task, and do it well
 - They take some input, and produce some output
 - Act as a "black-box": you don't need to know how the function
   is implemented.

Through this explanation, learners make appropriate connections 
to prior knowledge that aid in explaining:

 - scoping
 - modularity
 - abstraction
