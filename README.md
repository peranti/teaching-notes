The Why, What, and How of teaching Software Carpentry materials
===

In a recent [Software Carpentry][swc] workshop, I made the following 
observation about commenting code:

[swc]: http://software-carpentry.org

> There are three types of comments people typically make for their
> code. In order of usefulness, for others reading your code 
> (including your future self!), they are:
> 
> - *why*: what problem is this piece of code broadly trying to solve? 
>   Why do I care about reading this script/function?
> - *what*: what, specifically, does this function do (in plain english)?
>   What inputs is it expecting, what result does it return?
> - *how*: How does this code achieve that goal?
>
>
> At the novice level, when learning program, the comments you will
> most likely leave are the *how* kind: you'll leave notes to yourself
> about specific lines of code, to remind yourself of what that code is
> doing. This is usually not useful: one you gain familiarity with 
> programming, the *why* and the *what* are more important, as they allow
> you to abstract away code that you know works. The *how* comments usually
> simply serve as a learning exercise for the programmer when they're still
> gaining familiarity.

Post-hoc, I realised I'm at the same point with teaching: I'll go through
the existing software carpentry material trying to learn specific details 
of the script, without focusing on the important parts: the *why* and the 
*what*.

It is impossible to remember the script, no matter how well written, for
two-days worth of content, so it very quickly becomes an ad-libbing 
experience. The context for each concept, and each lesson, are what is
truly important. The syntax and the *how* will come naturally during
live coding.

This repository seeks to capture the *why* and the *what* of the Software 
Carpentry lesson materials on multiple scales; from the broad lesson strokes
right down to the individual programming concepts. I will then use this 
to prepare for future bootcamps. To acheive this aim, this repository will
document useful discipline-specific examples to act as intrinisic motivation,
personal anecdotes, as well as explanations that have worked well for
explaining concepts. 

These either come from myself, my own experience, or hearsay from other
instructors, and I welcome input.
